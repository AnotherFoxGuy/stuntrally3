- ⌨️ Input configuring (reassign keys, change sensitivity)

## Localization

Few languages fully available: 🇬🇧 🇩🇪 🇵🇱 🇫🇷 🇷🇺  
or partly 🇮🇹 🇨🇿 🇪🇸 [translated](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/stunt-rally-3/stunt-rally-3/#translations) with most main texts in game and editor.

## Gui and HUD ⏱️

- 🚦 Pacenotes - signs above road telling about:
  - turns (and their difficulty), long turns (more white), terrain bumps,
  - loops (few types), jumps (with required speed, match by color) and on pipe changes
- 🎗️ Racing line (Trail)
  - shows best way to drive, red colors for braking
- 🌍 Minimap, can be zoomed and rotated, _Todo:_ terrain and border toggle
- Driving aids
  - 🔝 arrow to next check point (HUD top)
  - next check point beam (on track)
  - track completion percentage %
  - time difference and current points shown on each checkpoint
- 📃 Detailed list of tracks with:
  - 🖼️ preview image and minimap (click to toggle zoom)
  - 📊 stats like: rating, difficulty, length, width, jumps, loops, pipes, obstacles and much more
  - Driveability % estimate for vehicle on track (low means unfit)
- ⏲️ Several gauge types (for engine rpm and vehicle speed)

## Graphics

- 8 Graphics presets for quick change to match hardware performance
- Many graphics options to tweak each feature individually
- PBS materials with normalmaps, roughness and fresnel
- Terrain triplanar mapping
- Reflections and fresnel (for Vehicles, water etc)
- Refraction for water

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Track Editor 🏗️🏞️

- Spline based road - no predefined sets or tiles, giving road absolute freedom in 3D, smoothed between points

## Tools

Game and editor both have few different tools for in command line.  
These tools can check tracks, warnings, challenges, convert track ghost etc.  
For details, start game or editor in console,  
with command line argument `?` or `help` to get their text info.  
Or see under Args::Help() in sources for [game](../src/game/SceneInit.cpp) and [editor](../src/editor/SceneInit.cpp).
