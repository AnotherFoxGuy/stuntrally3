## Version 3.0 beta

- Stunt Rally 3 is continuing last SR 2.x.  
- Graphics - moved to Ogre-Next 3.0
  - A **lot smoother and higher Fps**, also in split screen
    - No vegetation lags. Auto HW instancing. Good Fps with many objects/buildings, and road points in editor
  - Vegetation models - no impostors, now using meshes with LODs
    - Graphics Detail tab has new setting - for far Vegetation/Objects geometry reduction, aka LOD bias
  - **Horizons** - far terrains on many tracks, great landscape views
  - PBS materials - with roughness and fresnel/metalness. WIP, can be improved
    - New vehicle materials - with more parameters and new look
    - Color changing **paints**, 3 colors (on Gui) at once depending on view angle
    - New paints - Big set, over **450** total
    - [Materials](Materials.md) in new .json format with more posibilities e.g. detail maps
    - New syntax and new (more complicated) **HLMS** shaders, comparison and details in [Developing](Developing.md)
  - Better glass pipes - sorted, no random blinking
  - Vehicle front **lights** - new tab Lights in Graphics options, toggle key, WIP grass is not lit
- Game
  - Up to 6 players in Splitscreen or Multiplayer
  - Splitscreen 3D Hud available for each player: checkpoint arrow, beam, pacenotes, racing line
- Gui
  - Game Setup - Paints tab with more sliders and
    - Dynamic list with groups - Add,Delete,Load,Save buttons - saved in paints.ini
  - Tracks list: 3rd view
    - New columns with **user**'s track rating (slider) and bookmark (checkbox) for better orientation
  - Game window title showing mode and players count, changing color
  - More info on Fps bar (F11), colors from values (orange and red are very high), info on Gui
  - Settings for using cache and shaders debug, mouse capture and ogre dialog show.
- New **Material Editor**
  - Alt-F both in game and editor. Can save json, needs adjusting after, [info](Materials.md)
- Moved [**translations**](Localization.md) to [Weblate]((https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/stunt-rally-3/stunt-rally-3/))
- Editor
  - Many **terrains** - new Gui buttons: < Previous, > Next, + Add, X Delete, top right (same for Roads)
    - Enter - goes to next terrain, while editing with brushes (outside Gui)
  - Terrain **Brushes** - new set, 169 total
    - Dynamic list with groups - Add,Delete,Load,Save buttons - saved in brushes.ini and png (but slow)
    - Brush parameters - New tab with sliders and **Random** buttons. Colored values
    - Grid brushes, 3×3, 5×5 etc - can repeat N-gon type, repeat in OfsY parameter
  - Bigger terrain heightmaps - available, with good Fps. File size shown (2k is 16MB, 4k is 67MB!)
  - New tabs Fluids and Particles with lists (Alt-X) for easier picking, colored names
  - **Focus camera** on current (object, fluid, road point, anything) - key \
  - Fluids quality (diffuse, refract (not done yet), reflect) keys 1,2 - to reduce rendering when many on track
  - Update now saves terrain heightmaps, so F5 won't undo after
  - Particles scale - new parameter for size e.g. for bigger clouds in distance (keys K,L)
  - Terrain circle cursor - same size far/near, animated
  - Grass layer color - can pick any, no ColorMap combo
  - Sky preview map shown on Sky tab
  - Hud hide and Trail show checkboxes. New tab View, split from Settings
- Sources
  - Require building latest Ogre-Next and MyGui-Next fork from sources. Info in git [Building](Building.md) file
  - Reworked base class and new AppGui class, common for game and editor
  - Added **emojis**, for better code orientation in key sections and methods. Quick guide in [emojis file](../src/emojis.txt)
  - Only tinyxml2 used now, no tinyxml
  - Game and Editor tools can be started passing command line **argument**(s)
    - **cfg or config** forces showing Ogre dialog with screen and rendering options
    - Starting with ? shows help for all. In code search for _Tool_ or references to MainEntryPoints::args
- **Bugs** and notable **missing** features from SR 2.8, not yet present in SR 3.0:
  - Video options: Resolution, Vsync, Antialiasing, etc are not on Gui, but in Ogre dialog before start. No Limit Fps
    - Can't change them without quit. Also possibly alt-tab could require track reload on Windows.
  - Terrain shadowmap, Fluids: depth color, Refraction, smooth border. Grass deform, Trees wind.
  - HUD: minimap terrain or border, bad other position markers, bad in splitscreen: gauges, minimaps, digits etc
  - Editor
    - Slower road editing (~20 Fps not 60), added skip. Full Rebuild (B) takes quite _long_, columns need it
    - Bad reflection in editor F7 camera, less Fps (minimap RTTs don't skip, no terrain+road mode)
    - Object pick errors,  moved Terrains bad edit cursor pos
  - On older PCs: slower track loading (e.g. 5 sec not 1) and few lags due to long shaders compilation etc
  - Generally lighting changed due to sRGB colors (also using gamma to fix 1.15)
    - Every color in e.g. sun, particles, materials etc needs adjusting when converting from SR 2.x (make it darker, more saturated)
  - Grass not lit by vehicle lights, particles are unlit
