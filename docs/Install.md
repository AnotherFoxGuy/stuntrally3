## Introduction

This page is about how to install Stunt Rally (SR) and where to get it from.  
Provided are **Windows installer** and **GNU/Linux** binaries. No macOS, [info here](https://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally3/issues/36).  

Latest SR version 3.3 is here: **[Downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/stuntrally/files/3.3)**, on *sourceforge* Files tab.  
Previous 3.x versions are included on [Releases page](https://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally3/releases), on *github*, under Assets (have to click that).  

More info below on how to use them, after downloading.

----
## Windows

SR 3.3 and up has an archive `.zip`. Have to extract all files first, then start the `Stunt Rally-3.3-installer.exe` file.  
_Older SR versions had 1 installer `.exe` file._

Start this exe, and it will install game (and editor) in chosen destination (it should be a **new** folder).  
After installation shortcuts will appear in new Start Menu folder Stunt Rally.  
Tested on Windows 10, 64-bit.  

----
## GNU/Linux

Since SR 3.1 it has Linux **archive** `.tgz` or `.txz`. It includes binaries and libs.  
It is portable, just needs to be extracted (e.g. `tar xf StuntRally-3.2-Linux.txz`).  
Then by using included `.sh` scripts (in extracted game folder) you can start  
game with: `./stuntrally3.sh` or editor: `./sr-editor3.sh`.  
Tested on Debian 12 and on few other distros as VM. It was built on (and has libs from) VM Kubuntu 20.04.6.

### Sources

Other way is building from sources. Now easy with new `.py` script on Debian based, how to [here](Building.md).
