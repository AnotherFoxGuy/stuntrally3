## Introduction

This page is about how to install Stunt Rally and where to get it from.  
Provided are **Windows installer** and **GNU/Linux** binaries.  

Latest are located on the official **[Releases page](https://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally3/releases)** (on github).  

See details below for info how to use them.

----
## Windows

SR 3.0 and up has **installer** `.exe`.

It is an executable that will install game (and editor) in chosen destination (should be a **new** folder).  
After installation shortcuts will appear in new Start Menu folder Stunt Rally.   
Tested on Windows 10, 64-bit.  

----
## GNU/Linux

Since SR 3.1 it has Linux **archive** `.tgz` or `.txz`. It includes binaries and libs.  
It is portable, just needs to be extracted (e.g. `tar xf StuntRally-3.2-Linux.txz`).  
Then by using included `.sh` scripts (in extracted game folder) you can start  
game with: `./stuntrally3.sh` or editor: `./sr-editor3.sh`.  
Tested on Debian 12 and on few other distros as VM. It was built on (and has libs from) VM Kubuntu 20.04.6.
