Guide for SR3 source code, Ogre-Next (links) and tools used.  
Can be useful if you want to:
- develop SR3, test or fix a bug
- learn more about SR3 code, find something in it
- learn about Ogre-Next used in SR3 or other libraries etc
- fork SR3 code and start your own project (required GPLv3 or newer) based on it

## IDE

Recommended:
- [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download) - easier to set up first, CMake is integrated
- [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases) - used by CryHam, needs more to set up. Info on [my guide](https://cryham.tuxfamily.org/cpp-guide/#VSCodium).  
Has its files in repo, in subdir `.vscode/`.  
Some extensions and IDE preferences in `settings.json` and  
in `launch.json` configurations (for binaries) are set up, to run or debug.

# Ogre-Next

Is the engine used for rendering, managing scene, also loading resources, logging to `.log` files etc.

- [Manual](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre-next/api/latest/manual.html) - need to read it when beginning.
- [Compositor](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre-next/api/latest/compositor.html) - for effects, RTTs, reflections, etc.
- [comparison](https://www.ogre3d.org/about/what-version-to-choose) of Ogre and Ogre-Next.

## HLMS, materials, shaders

**HLMS** is the part in Ogre-Next responsible for generating shaders used in materials.  
There is no shader graph editor, everything is in big text files.  

- [HLMS doc](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre-next/api/latest/hlms.html) - long read, explains all.
- [Ogre wiki](https://wiki.ogre3d.org/Ogre+2.1+FAQ#I_m_writing_my_own_Hlms_implementation_or_just_want_to_know_more_about_it._Where_do_I_find_learning_material_resources_) - with links to old forum topics about common tasks.

It is very complex and extensive, it covers plenty of conditions for shader variations (in .any files).  
We have own shaders for:
- **Terra** for terrain, with layers, triplanar, based on PBS.  
Main files in `/Media/Hlms/Terra/Any`.
- **PBS**, regular shaders for all materials (objects, road,  cars, vegetation etc).  
Main files in `/Media/Hlms/Pbs/Any/Main`.  
I'm writing **water**/fluids also inside PBS, don't want to split.
- Unlit (not lighting). We should only use this for **Gui**.  
**Particles** must be at least: colored by sun diffuse, darker by shadows, also by terrain.
Small files in `/home/ch/_sr/og3/_sr`/Media/Hlms/Unlit/Any`.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Old Ogre comparison

Everything with materials is different. In **old** SR with Ogre, we used shiny material generator with its own `.shader` syntax and `.mat` files.  
Now in SR3 with Ogre-Next we use HLMS and **new** PBS materials.

### ‚≠ê Old

From old `.mat` files such parameters are gone:
- `ambient` color (nothing in new), `specular` power exponent (4th number, use new `roughness` for this)
- `env_map true`, `refl_amount`

### üå† New

We use default `specular_workflow`, metallic workflow is simpler.  
New HLMS `.material` parameters:
- roughness 0.001 to 1.0 (replaces old specular power exponent).
- metalness (not to be used in specular_workflow?).
- fresnel is amount aand fresnel_coeff is color of _reflection_ (mirror)
- _ToDo:_ reflection (old `env_map`), is now as re="1" in `presets.xml`.
- for terrain layer textures these parames are in `presets.xml` as `ro - roughness, me - metalness, re - reflection`.

Currently editing files is the only way like before.  
Main `.material` **files** are in `/Media/materials/Pbs`.  
Materials can be adjusted real-time in SR3 Track Editor: from Options, on tab **Tweak**, find material and use sliders etc.  
_ToDo:_ this should be our main tool, needs saving .material .json files.  
There is also that `.material.json` format, longer and more advanced, not too great to edit by hand.

----
## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tools

Advanced extra tools, should be used when testing or developing new (bigger) things in game or editor:
- [Renderdoc](https://renderdoc.org/) - For debugging GPU, tracking rendered frame, its draw calls, shaders, textures etc.
- [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) - For debugging CPU, memory leaks etc.
- [ASAN](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) - same as above?

# Stunt Rally 3

## config files

[user] - means file is in user `.config/stuntrally3` dir, and saved by SR3.  
Otherwise, means a static file in `config/` dir, manually edited.  
(i) - means file has info about itself and syntax, written inside.

Vehicles config
- config/cars.xml - (i) list for Vehicles tab with manually set parameters
- Media/cars/cameras.xml - (i) all follow camera views for game
- Media/carsim/[mode]/* -  
*.car - vehicle file (can edit directly in game Alt-Z),  
*_stats.xml - vehicle performance test results (after Ctrl-F5)  
.tire coeffs, suspension

Game modes
- championships.xml - (i) for Gui, tutorials too
- challenges.xml - (i) with tracks list, pass conditions, game setup etc

Game progress
- progress.xml, progress_rev.xml - [user] progress for championships, _rev for reversed
- progressL.xml, progressL_rev.xml - [user] same but for challenges

Game config
- input.xml and input_p[1..4].xml - [user] for game, common and player input bindings, Gui tab Input

- paint.cfg - current vehicles paint setups
- paints.ini - dynamic list for vehicles on Paints tab

Common config
- fluids.xml - (i) 
- presets.xml - params for editor lists and game too
- tracks.xml - [user] tracks bookmark and rating, from Gui Track tab

Below * means: nothing or 2,3,4.. etc if more.
- heightmap*.f32 - heightmap(s) for terrain(s). Format is raw 32 bit floats (4B for 1 height). Size always square: 512,1024,2048 etc.
- road*.xml - file(s) for each road/river etc. Has many params and points.
- scene.xml - 1 file for each track, with all editable params from Gui tabs in Track Editor.

## emojis

You can also get familiar with `src/emojis` file.  
It lists many emojis used for indentifying code sections, variable blocks etc in sources.  
Done for better orientation, grouping and cooler code in files, especially for big ones with many at once.  

## subdirs

SR3 code is in `src/` its subdirs are:
- [btOgre2](https://github.com/Ybalrid/BtOgre2) - [lib] for visualisation of bullet debug lines in Ogre-Next (called Ogre 2.1 before)
- common - files for both editor and game. Mainly for common Gui, scene (map / track) elements.
Has also some MyGui classes a bit extended: `MultiList2.*, Slider*.*, Gui_Popup.*` and `GraphView.*` for game Graphs (Tweak F9).
- common/data - has all data structures (mostly xml config files, list below).
- editor - purely editor sources
- game - purely game sources
- network - game multiplayer code, mostly written by Tapio, has `DesignDoc.txt`. Also `master-server/` program for server game list (not used).
- OgreCommon - [Ogre-Next] base application classes - slightly changed.
- [oics](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oics/) - [lib] for input configurations, bindings and analog key inputs emulation.
- Terra - terrain component, from [Ogre-Next] - modified.
- sound - sound engine, based on [RoR]'s, using openal-soft
- vdrift - SR simulation (based on old [VDrift] from about 2010) with a lot of changes and custom code,  
Also has simulation for spaceships, sphere etc.


## Ogre-Next

SR has 

## Modified

Components completely new with Ogre-Next.

### Atmosphere

Only used for **fog** and its params.  
It can produce sky atmosphere with sun, and no clouds. We don't use this.

### Terra

The terrain component. Very efficient. Has triplanar already.  
Extended with old SR blendmap RTT and its noise.

## Custom

### HlmsPbs2

### Compositor

## Changed from SR

These have changed when porting to SR3 to use Ogre-Next.

### Road

### Vegetation

### Grass

## Old SR

Rest of code that was same in SR 2.x. Only small changes when porting to SR3.

### Simulation

Update

### Replay
