Help is welcomed.  
Thank you for all your contributions.

Even smaller things count like:
- Testing and reporting a bug.
- Sharing an honest opinion, or idea on Forum.
- Constructive discussion about features, etc.
- Improving a translation to a language.
- Spreading info about Stunt Rally on internet.


Below is a list (in no order, just my favorite 2 first)
of bigger focused contributions:

------------------------
## Programmers

If you know C++, [Ogre-Next](https://forums.ogre3d.org/viewforum.php?f=25) (2 and up) or shaders,  
and preferably could handle some of the [Roadmap](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=roadmap) tasks.  
Own ideas could also go into SR, just need some discussion first.  
Most ideas are already in [Tasks](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/mantis/view_all_bug_page.php). Sorted by P (priority): 1 is most important, higher are less so.

Medium changes can go through [pull requests](https://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally/pulls).  
For those with more time and effort, commits to main branch will be possible.

There is no style guide (yet), I simply recommend following my own.  
A quick info: it is not random, it's quite specifically formatted to how I want it to be (in my files).

------------------------
## Track creators

If you manage to create an interesting track, it can be included in future versions.  
Tracks are shared on [this forum](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=80).  
If needed I usually finish them and improve FPS (performance), may change something.  
Tracks are licensed GPLv3 by default.

------------------------
## Testers

If you found a bug please report it, info [here](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=troubleshooting).  
Even better if you're able to build from sources.  
If so, then also honest, constructive opinions or suggestions (e.g. about my latest changes) are welcome, on Forum.

## Packagers

If you have experience in packaging software or games, for some OS distributions,  
or know how to improve building from sources (or make it easier).

------------------------
## Translators

If you want to help translating a language, check Wiki page [Localization](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=localization).

------------------------
## Sound Artists

If you can record or edit sounds for games. Especially looped engine sounds.

## 3D Artists

If you know Blender and can help with importing existing models into game [Objects wiki](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=objects).  
Or can edit vehicles ([topic](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=80&t=18526) and [wiki](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=carmodeling)) or objects for game, UV unwrap, texturing, etc.
